# Recall

## What is this?
An app that converts your study material (PDFs, videos, audio, etc.) into interactive flashcards, study grids, and practice quizzes.


## The Problem
Students don't like studying from boring notebooks and textbooks. Generic online tools (Quizlet, Khan Academy) use their content, not your teacher's exact material - leading to mismatches and confusion (like learning there are 8 planets when your teacher's notes say 9, including dwarf planets).
Reading 2+ pages of dense text feels overwhelming. Fancy graphics and animations make learning actually engaging.


## The Solution
Upload YOUR class material → Get instant study tools with:

1. Interactive flashcards (click to flip, navigate, shuffle)
2. Visual study grids (clean, modern, animated)
3. Practice quizzes (multiple choice + type-in, tracks score, reviews wrong answers)

All using your teacher's exact content, presented in a way that doesn't suck.
